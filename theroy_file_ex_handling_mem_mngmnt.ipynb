        "Ans) Memory management in Python is an important aspect of ensuring the efficient execution of programs, but it also comes with several challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "->  While Python uses automatic memory management via garbage collection, it can sometimes lead to inefficiencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Python relies on a reference counting mechanism to manage memory, where each object keeps track of the number of references to it.\n",

        "\n",
        "-> To deal with circular references, Python uses a cyclic garbage collector, which can sometimes fail to collect objects in certain complex scenarios, causing memory to be unused or leaked.\n",
        "\n",
        "->  The garbage collector might not run immediately, leading to memory that is still in use or not released when the program expects it.\n",
        "\n",
        "->  This can cause excessive memory usage, especially in long-running applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Memory management in Python is largely abstracted away, which simplifies development but also presents challenges in resource-constrained environments.\n",
        "\n",
